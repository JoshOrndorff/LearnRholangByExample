## Target Audience
This tutorial aims to be novice-friendly and introduce rholang from the ground
up. If you've never ever programmed before, you may struggle at times, but
if you know how to write a little python or javascript, you've got all the
background I've assumed.

 I'm not expecting you to be familiar with process calculi, be a master of any other languages, or  understand all the theoretical math discussed in the RChain community.
